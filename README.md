## üöù rx-router

This is a router for [rx-dom](https://github.com/lifaon74/rx-dom).

**It is now in BETA. Please use with caution and provide feedback.**


## üì¶ Installation

```bash
yarn add @lifaon/rx-router
# or
npm install @lifaon/rx-router --save
```

This library supports:

- **common-js** (require): transpiled as es5, with .cjs extension, useful for old nodejs versions
- **module** (esm import): transpiled as esnext, with .mjs extension (requires node resolution for external packages)

In a **node** environment the library works immediately (no extra tooling required),
however, in a **browser** environment, you'll probably need to resolve external imports thought a bundler like
[snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/),
[rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/),
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
etc...
or directly using [skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/):
